## Setup and Run Backend AspNet Application
  
1. **Download the files from Github**
2. **Using the visual studio**
3. **Open the solution**
4. **If Visual Studio does not have the DotNet Sdk 8 the IDE will advise to install the new version.**
5. **Verify if it is configured to run on http, even has configurations to run on https or using docker, I did not test, and probably have change the API port in frontend project.**
6. **Press the play button or F5 on keyboard.**

## Approach and Challenges, and Overcomes

I used the Asp Net 8 with Entity Framework Core 8, that is the lasted version, I configured SQLite due it is a serverless database, and I can embed it without much cost in software to use. I considered Mongo DB due they released an official Entity Framework Support to the Version 8 but due the time I to follow a way that I know.

The challenge was with Entity Framework, I have experience, most with version 6, but I believe that does not have much difference between these versions. It has some weird behaviours. Firstly the I resolved change the model of category and status, from string to int, due the idea that it is to be a list so I developed a another relation for this fields, so I put categoryId and statusId in Equipment model, but when I save the form, Even though I haven't configured directly the operations of CRUD in this tables it was saving the default values as new and auto increment the IDâ€¦ and when back to the view list it showed nothing. So, I excluded the tables and just put a handle in frontend using Enums.


## Potential Improvements

- Implement correctly the Database relations with the table Status and Category, I would like to do the functions to add it in separate screen, initially I thought that it was possible to do in 6 hours.
- Configure the system to run on https, and docker, probably it will run but I did not tested, or configured the database in docker file.
- I have more ideas to expand it, but it is outside the scope of the test.
